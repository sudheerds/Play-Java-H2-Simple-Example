This is your new Play application
=================================

This file will be packaged with your application, when using `activator dist`.

This is a simple Play-java application that demostrates the use of the default database H2 that comes with play,
its easy and very easy to use. But remmeber to replace it with production database such as mysql or oracle, in the
development mode H2 is fine but for production its not recoomended. But H2 is a good beginning to start learning ORM
and evolutions. 

Hope you find this useful
